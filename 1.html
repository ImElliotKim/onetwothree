<p style="margin-bottom:100px; margin-top:100px;">In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.
In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.
Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.</p>

<p>That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>
